## Improve infer_pairwise_events algorithm

### Experiment with the following approach:

#### Collect all transcripts in a gene 
#### Label nodes for each transcript as is done currently
#### Identify common nodes and nodes that are specific to a subset of transcripts
#### Iterate over specific nodes: 

##### For a given specific node in a given transcript, iterate outward over transcript nodes until a pair is reached that are common to all transcripts
##### The resulting event is then the collection of unique paths between the common nodes
##### Note that this approach generalizes the event calling to non-binary events

##### Propose splitting classifications into binary (including SE, MS etc - all current event types) and non-binary (propose NF, NL, NM for non-binary first, last, and middle)
##### Non-binary events can be potentially re-classified post-quantification. If an isoform never exceeds a given percentage, it can be pruned. Consequently, many ostensibly non-binary events may become binary.
